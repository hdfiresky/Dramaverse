When he discovers a mysterious music store, he's unexpectedly transported back to 1995, where he meets his father, Ha I Chan, as a high schooler. I Chan doesn't recognize him and is infatuated with a cellist, Se Gyeong, not Eun Gyeol's mother, Cheong A. To set things right, Eun Gyeol joins a band led by I Chan, hoping to reunite his future parents and return to the present",

    "description": "It is a story that resembles a tribute to our parents' tender and still youthful seasons when they were so young, including the story of mother's first love, father's heroic tales, grandma's rebellious youth, and grandpa's romantic era. Ae Sun is rebellious but gets nervous every time she rebels. She is not well off but is always shining and full of positivity. She dreams of becoming a poet, although she cannot attend school, and she is a bold character who doesn’t hide any emotions. Gwan Sik is an extremely diligent and quiet character. Romance is not a strength for him, and he doesn’t know how to act if Ae Sun cries or laughs, but he is a silent warrior who only loves Ae Sun from the very beginning and pours his all into loving her",

    "description": "In sixth-century China, the Emperor of Great Liang orders the unjust execution of his brother-in-law Marshal Lin Xie alongside the Lin family, his 70,000 army soldiers, and Crown Prince Qi. Secretly surviving the massacre is Lin Xie's son, Lin Shu, who undergoes medical treatment that changes his appearance entirely and leaves him in a weakened state, unable to ever perform martial arts again. Lin Shu changed his name to Mei Chang Su and later became the chief of the pugilist world and established the Jiangzuo Alliance. Twelve years later, Mei Chang Su returns to the capital with a secret plan after being sought after by Prince Yu and Prince Xian during their fight for the throne. He decides to covertly assist Prince Jing, the unfavoured son of the Emperor, and wisely rids the court of all scheming officials. ~~ Adapted from the novel \\\\\"Lang Ya Bang\\\\\" () by Hai Yan ()",

He works for his father’s business “Move To Heaven,” a company that specializes in crime scene cleanup, where they also collect and arrange items left by deceased people, and deliver them to the bereaved family. When Geu Roo's father dies, Geu Roo's guardianship passes to his uncle, ex-convict Cho Sang Gu, who is a martial arts fighter in underground matches. Per the father's will, Sang Gu must care for and work with Geu Roo in “Move To Heaven” for three months to gain full guardianship and claim the inheritance.
